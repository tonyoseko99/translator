## Description
Flask Translator is a simple web application that translates text into any language available in the Microsoft Translator Text API. It uses the Flask web framework and the Translator Text API to handle user input and translation requests.

## Getting Started
To get started with Flask Translator, you will need to do the following:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Set your Translator Text API subscription key and endpoint in a `.env` file. An example `.env` file is provided in this repository.
4. Run `python app.py` to start the Flask application.

## Usage
Once the Flask application is running, you can access the translation page by navigating to `http://localhost:5000/` in your web browser. From there, enter the text you want to translate and select the target language from the dropdown menu. Click the "Translate" button to submit the request and view the translated text.
